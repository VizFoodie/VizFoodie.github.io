Puff pastry here in the Netherlands is a pest to use in regular large pies becuase it comes in a box of 10 small individual squares. think jig-saw pieces then you want to make a large pie, and it usually takes me less time to make and roll my own... but my small ready made squares are PERFECT for this recipe.. if you are lucky enough to be able to buy ready made puff pastry in one big piece you will need to cut it up to fit.
COMFORT FOOD... the fillings are as endless as peoples' personal taste.. but things that cook quick, yes? I used three Knackworstjes but the Zaar database doesn't recognise those so Smokies (mini knackworstjes) are the closest description I can get.
